# NBA Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard that extracts data from the balldontlie API (https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction) before transforming it into a useable data model that supports advanced data visualizations.

The dashboard is still in progress. The repository, including this Readme, will be updated as additions are made.
