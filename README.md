# NBA Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard that extracts data from the Balldontlie API (https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction) before transforming it into a usable data model that supports advanced data visualizations.

The dashboard is still in progress. The repository, including this Readme, will be updated as additions are made.

# Location and Team Overview

The teams are shown on the World map, separated by their respective divisions. <br>

# Individual Team Overview

This page shows an overview of a team's performance throughout the current season. The team is chosen via a slicer. The page includes the team's home and away game results. The page will also provide key statistics used to determine how well a team is doing. Key statistics include the average number of points scored (and how it compares to the average number of points conceded), average rebounds per game, average steals per game, 3-point field goal percentage and overall field goal percentage. The page will also show how their points scored have been distributed amongst the roster. The entire roster is also displayed with detailed season statistics. It is easy for users to find the good vs the bad for each team as the colour scheme provides a quick indication of how a team is doing. Below, you can see how a low-ranked team's view can differ from one of the league's best. The dashboard also includes buttons that lead the user to more detailed views.

# Historic Data

# League Leaders (Players)
The players with the best averages in multiple categories are shown here. The first page has the values looked at commonly whereas the second page goes into further depth. The visuals follow a gradient colour pattern to identify categories with larger disparities. Filters are also provided on the top left to focus on conferences and/or divisions. All categories will include a minimum number of games the players must have played to avoid outliers. Tooltips provide more information on the player's team.
